**Performing EDA on Framingham Dataset**

*An Exploratory Data Analysis performed on the Framingham Dataset to predict heart disease.*

Centered on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Framingham dataset, this repository aims to unveil the 10-year risk of heart disease development. Through meticulous handling of missing values, dataset cleaning, and thorough exploration, the project delves into understanding the intricate relationships between different factors and the initiation of heart disease.
